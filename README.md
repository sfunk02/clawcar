## Introduction
For this project, we were assigned to create something that uses a robot arm. Our constraints consisted of 2 months of time and materials available in the lab or any materials that could be easily obtained. We had access to hardware, acrylic, a laser cutter, and 3D printers to create our robot.

## Planning_Stage

Inital problems we faced in planning our project were deciding whether to control the car via Bluetooth or an infrared universal TV remote. We also didn't know whether we wanted to use a SCARA arm or an articulated arm.. We ended up choosing infrared over Bluetooth because Bluetooth seemed overly complicated and unnecessary for what we were trying to achieve, and we chose an articulated arm over a SCARA arm because a SCARA arm didn't seem like it would be strong enough to lift anything vertically while also moving horizontally.
